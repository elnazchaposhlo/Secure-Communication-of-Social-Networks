# Secure-Communication-of-Social-Networks
Secure Communication of Social Networks implementation using Python.

Guided by:
    Dr. Shaoquan Jiang and Dr. Kalyani Selvarajah

This is a group project. The projectâ€™s aim is to provide an approach that will make internet communication more secure. This project involves establishing a group key agreement without a central authority. The users are only in communication with their network neighbours which eliminates the involvement of indirectly connected users and servers. We have implemented such a protocol based on the work of Dr. Shaoquan Jiang.
