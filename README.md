# Secure-Communication-of-Social-Networks
Secure Communication of Social Networks implementation using Python.

Guided by:
    Dr. Shaoquan Jiang and Dr. Kalyani Selvarajah

The project’s aim is to provide an approach that will make internet communication more secure. This project involves establishing a group key agreement without a central authority. The users are only in communication with their network neighbours which eliminates the involvement of indirectly connected users and servers. We have implemented such a protocol based on the work of Dr. Shaoquan Jiang. 

Having a safe environment for online communication is a very important aspect of social networks which motivated us to work on this project.Our sensitive and personal information like credit card or social insurance number are at potential risk from a host of unwanted users. However, if the users are only aware of their neighbors in the network, this will significantly lower that risk. Therefore, we have endeavored in our project to implement a ‘Secure Communication of Social Networks’ which will allow users to communicate safely, by not using a central authority to preserve and protect the user’s privacy and identity from malicious third parties.
